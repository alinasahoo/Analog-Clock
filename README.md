# Analog Clock

Yay, back with another super cool  & exciting project. I created an analog clock with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This could be another beginner level project, learnt from the course entitled: JavaScript Essential Training on LinkedIn Learning. It took me approximately(1 hr) for the completion. Simple, easy to implement.
